A simple arena-based allocator for C with the objective of simplifying memory management, while still giving the programmer full control, emphasizing C philosophy that the programmer knows best. This is still currently a work in progress, and the API isn't guaranteed to change or be stable. Please report any bugs in the github issues, along with any relevant information such as code, data structures, and schema involved.
